        <h4>Whats is Vuesax?</h4>
        <p>
          Vuesax (pronounced / vjusacksÀê /, as view sacks) is a framework of UI
          components created with Vuejs to make projects easily and with a
          unique and pleasant style, vuesax is created from scratch and designed
          for all types of developers from the frontend lover to the backend who
          wants to easily create their visual approach to the end-user We are
          focused on streamlining the work of the programmer by giving
          components created in their entirety and with independent
          customization and very easy to implement, so creativity is in our
          hands but we do not neglect that each project is different both
          visually and in its ecosystem Vuesax does not have a design line such
          as other component frameworks based on Material Design, we believe
          that there are already emaciated frameworks that look visually and in
          UI / UX and we don't want to be one more of the bunch, apart from that
          we love to create and design new experiences and surprise you with new
          elements or details that we can only do by being visually free.
        </p>

        <h4>Why Vuesax?</h4>

        <p>
          Vuesax is a relatively new framework with a refreshing design and in
          the latest trends, vuesax based on vuejs which means that we go hand
          in hand with one of the most popular javascript frameworks in the
          world and with a huge community with which you will have all the help
          and documentation to create and make your project
          <br />
          <br />
          - Vuesax, unlike many frameworks, is designed from scratch and we are
          not anchored to any design line, this is something great since your
          project is going to be unique and very different from the others

          <br />
          <br />
          - We are focused on the quick and easy creation of projects giving a
          beautiful visual line but without forgetting the personalization and
          independence of the developer

          <br />
          <br />
          - Vuesax uses native css variables for better customization and
          production changes such as changing to dark theme or changing the main
          color of the entire application with few javascript lines
          <br />
          <br />

          - Vuesax is a frame designed to have a great visual impact and that is
          always in trend with respect to design.
          <br />
          <br />

          - An open-source community to create, improve and correct any
          component or function.
          <br />
          <br />

          - Independent components to avoid importing unnecessary code.
          <br />
          <br />

          - Markdown documents for better sustainability.
          <br />
          <br />

          - and much more.
